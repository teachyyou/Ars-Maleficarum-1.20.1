      "text": "During the demon summoning, one of the crucial moments is to imprison it before it breaks free and starts spreading chaos. Improvised constructions of blocks may suffice, but they are cumbersome and impractical. This paragraph describes three variations of the imprisonment ritual - reinforcing symbols that form the circle to prevent demons from passing through, creating a kind of barrier. Imprisonment or containment rituals are the foremost means of security for any practitioner of summoning. It is recommended to know the components by heart and always carry some chalk or two."
