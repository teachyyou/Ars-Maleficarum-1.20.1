As the mandrake matures, its root increasingly resembles a small human figure - perhaps this is how magic, once embedded in this plant, has altered its form. When attempting to extract the root from the ground, if not handled carefully enough, it will awaken, uproot itself, and attempt to flee. Capturing this escapee is no easy task, considering the piercing scream emitted by the root as it panics, trying to evade the persistent herbalist."
