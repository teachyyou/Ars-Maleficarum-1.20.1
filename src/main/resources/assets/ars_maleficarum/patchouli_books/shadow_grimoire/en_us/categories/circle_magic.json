  "description": "This section of the grimoire unveils the most potent tool in the arsenal of any advanced practitioner - the sorcery of ritual circles. By combining them, one can perform rites of varying complexity and power, from cultivating greenery on a mound of earth to, as legends tell of ancient archmages, summoning meteoric rains and invoking earthquakes. Furthermore, ritual sorcery enables the creation of more potent artifacts than infusion and other previously known methods.",
