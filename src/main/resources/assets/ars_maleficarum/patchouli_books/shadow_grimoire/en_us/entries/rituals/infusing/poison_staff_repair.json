There is a ritual with two variations that allows the staff's power to be restored, significantly extending its lifespan and preventing it from crumbling to dust with the last used grain of power. The witch can choose the appropriate ritual variation based on her current capabilities."

In this case, the ritual can be performed with just the small circle and a trivial set of components. However, it is not always possible to venture into the swamps and perform the ritual. For such cases, there is a second variant of the ritual - more expensive but not requiring a trip to the swamps for fresh larvae."
