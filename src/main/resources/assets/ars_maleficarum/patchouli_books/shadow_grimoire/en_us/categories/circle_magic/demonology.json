  "description": "This section of the book is dedicated to the rituals of summoning, binding, and banishing - the primary means by which practitioners interact with the Nether. Eventually, everyone hits a ceiling they cannot surpass without delving into demonology - the power emanating from demons is too great to ignore. More detailed information about the Nether and its inhabitants is contained in a separate chapter on demons.",
