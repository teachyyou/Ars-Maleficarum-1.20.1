It turns out that with the help of circle magic, its essence can be transformed, shifting its allegiance from the Sun to the Moon. This results in a new species of purely magical origin - $(l:plants/moonlight_flower)Moonlight Flower$(). $(br2)$(l)Note:$() The ritual must be performed under the open sky with the Moon at its zenith."
