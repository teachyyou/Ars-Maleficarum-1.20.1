  "description": "One of the most essential skills that distinguishes any respectable witch is a good knack for potion making. Potions, created through various methods (mainly using the brewing cauldron), offer a powerful means of enhancing oneself. You cannot bottle a speed ritual and carry it in your bag, but you can certainly do so with a trusty vial of bubbling potion.",
