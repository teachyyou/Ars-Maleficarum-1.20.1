According to legend, a mighty druid, who had lost his son to human greed and avarice, sought revenge and, sacrificing himself, cast a vile curse that would bring terrible suffering to those who touched the bewitched gold. Centuries passed, the curse was lifted, but many metal deposits remained forever tainted."
