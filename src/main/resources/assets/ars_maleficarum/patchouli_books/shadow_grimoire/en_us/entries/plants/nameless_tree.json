This charcoal exhibits a high degree of catalysis when producing concentrates by burning plant materials in a special furnace. Moreover, it enables the casting of enchantments, a process that, in many cases, was considered hopelessly long without the aid of a catalyst."

Or maybe its true name was buried and forgotten, along with its secrets, tormenting the minds of many generations of wizards? What lies behind this veil of ignorance? The question seems extraordinarily intriguing, awakening interest and the desire to find an answer."
