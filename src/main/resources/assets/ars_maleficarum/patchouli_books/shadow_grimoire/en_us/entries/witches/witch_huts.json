This period saw the emergence of the art of witchcraft, with an essential attribute being the solitary hut amidst forests or swamps. Many who have visited these witches describe their huts as larger inside than they appear from the outside."

Their magic thrived in swamps and forests, nourished by a constant connection to nature, remote and untouched by society. In these places, the power of witches is especially potent, and they are in no hurry to leave. If they must fight, they prefer to do so on their own turf."
