# Ars Maleficarum

## Description
Ars Maleficarum is a Forge-based mod inspired by masterpieces like Witchery and Thaumcraft. The theme of the mod revolves around the magical arts of witches, incorporating many successful elements from Witchery and introducing new features designed by our development team. Originally developed as a student project at SFedU, the mod has proven to be successful and promising, motivating the team to continue its development. We hope to one day achieve millions of downloads on CurseForge and master the tools to bring even more exciting and beautiful features to life.
